Kaggle Datasets (over 80 features!)

A lot of feature engineering before the training and predicting:
  - manual feature selection
  - data types handling (assigning either categorical or numerical values)
  - missing values analysis and replacing
  - backward elimination of features
  - feature scaling

Training and tuning ML regression algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Gradient Boosting
